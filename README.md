## The technical and architectural choices
I decided to use the Vue library only without library for managing routing, state management nor testing so that I would finish the project fast wit minimal requirements. But as I was building I realised a lot things would have been done with ease like managing views without routing instead of doing all that programmatically

## Improvements I could add to my submission and what I would do differently
- I ignored a lot of useful tools like Vue-Router which would have allowed me to make app navigation easier due to deadline but it's definitely something I would consider improving
- A better design would also be good. Bootstrap is easier to use but a bit rigid when it comes to bending it to one's needs, hence Tailwind CSS my be a good choice if I had more time
- I would also do a bit of testing to the project
